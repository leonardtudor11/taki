## Stop protocol (unattended runs)
At each session: build → test → (audit) → update this table → `git commit`. If a session is BLOCKED (missing key/auth/decision): mark it, skip to the next *independent* session that is fixture-testable, and log the blocker here. Never fake a passing test.

## Live state (May 26)
- Vertex AI: live via ADC at `~/.config/gcloud/adc_taki.json` (project `project-2be42b84-14e0-421a-b3a`).
- Bright Data: live via Unlocker zone `taci_unlocker` (~$0.0015/req).
- Real run: `data/vercel/brief.json` (2 buying / 1 hiring / 2 pricing / 9 risk; 8 ungrounded dropped → guardrail working).
- Tests: 50/50.

## Active /ultraplan upgrade — V1→V3→V4→V2
- **V1.1** Logo + identity reset — ✅ done (inline SVG monoline 滝 = 3 cyan/green/amber streams with draw-in animation; warm-ink palette; Fraunces+Inter+JBMono mix; vermilion 朱 accent; left stream-lane gutter replaces panel grid). frontend/index.html only; selectors preserved → app.js + cascade-flow.js untouched.
- **V3** Interactive cascade graph (cytoscape.js + GSAP, CDN, no build) — **next**
- **V4** UI/UX polish (ui-ux-pro-max skill, 21st.dev patterns, vanilla HTML/JS)
- **V2** Real LangGraph backend (StateGraph + parallel dept nodes; same CascadeBrief output)
